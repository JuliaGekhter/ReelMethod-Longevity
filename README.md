# Shape The Wave Longevity™ — Ecosystem Site

> Optimize health. Align habits. Live longer, better.

A single-page marketing + product site for **Shape The Wave Longevity™** — powered by
the **REEL™ Align Method** and **ReelVerse AI™**. It presents the brand story end to
end and lets visitors browse and compare membership plans.

See [`BRAND.md`](./BRAND.md) for the canonical brand reference.

## Sections
1. **Hero** — brand, tagline, core message, and a call to action.
2. **The REEL™ Align Method** — the five-step framework: *Reflect · Envision · Execute · Learn · Align*.
3. **The Locked Hierarchy** — the four locked tiers, top to bottom:
   Shape The Wave Longevity™ → REEL™ Align Method™ → ReelVerse AI™ → ReelVerse OS™.
4. **The ReelVerse Ecosystem** — Coach, Mirror, Compass, Momentum, Academy, plus the
   **Certified REEL Method Practitioner™** credential.
5. **Membership Plans** — searchable/filterable/sortable browser of all 21 plans.

## Tech
Plain static site — **HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript**. No build step, no
dependencies, no backend.

## Run it

**Option A — just open it.** Open `index.html` in a browser. Membership data is inlined
as a fallback, so the page works straight from the file system.

**Option B — serve it locally** (recommended; loads data from `data/memberships.json`):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Project structure

```
index.html            Full single-page site (nav, hero, method, hierarchy, ecosystem, memberships)
styles.css            Brand theming + responsive layouts
app.js                Membership data loading + search/filter/sort/price logic
data/memberships.json The 21 membership plans (source of truth)
BRAND.md              Canonical Final Brand Summary
```

## Updating the data

Edit `data/memberships.json` — each plan looks like:

```json
{
  "source": "Original",
  "name": "Essential Wellness",
  "price": 114,
  "recurrence": "Monthly",
  "discount": null,
  "annualizedPrice": 1368,
  "benefits": "1 Lipo or B12 shot, Tanita scan, lifestyle consult (with basic lab)"
}
```

When served over HTTP the app reads this file directly. If you also want the
direct-open (`file://`) path to reflect changes, mirror them into the
`FALLBACK_PLANS` array at the top of `app.js`.

## Notes
- Pricing is for reference only; benefits are subject to consultation and availability.
- 21 plans total: 13 original + 8 added 6/19. *Mental Health Membership* intentionally
  shows placeholder benefits / cadence pending finalization.
